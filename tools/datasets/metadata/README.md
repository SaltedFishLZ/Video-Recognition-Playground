# Make Dataset Datapoints

This toolbox is used to generate datapoints file for each dataset. It is very hard to make a general metadata collector, so we decide to manually build datapoint collecting scripts and label annotating scripts for each dataset.

These scripts might depend on `torchstream`, `torchvision` or `torch`.
